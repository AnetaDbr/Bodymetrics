1. App Overview & Objectives
App Name: TBD — working name: “BodyTrack Pro”
Goal: The ultimate mobile app for tracking weight, body measurements, and photos in a motivational, clean, and professional way. No unnecessary features, only what’s needed to do this job perfectly.
Primary Objective: Deliver the fastest, most visually engaging way to track progress toward body goals for fitness enthusiasts who want focus, not bloat.

2. Target Audience
Fitness enthusiasts seeking a simple, beautiful tracker for weight and measurements.

People on weight-loss or muscle-gain journeys who value progress visualization.

Users frustrated with big, bloated apps like MyFitnessPal or Samsung Health.

3. Core Features
Free Tier

Track weight + up to 3 fixed measurements (waist, thigh, arm).

View progress graphs (weight + 3 measurements) with goal prediction line.

View photos (no side-by-side comparison).

Basic BMI calculation.

Premium Tier

Unlimited measurements & ability to mark favourites.

Custom reminders/notifications.

Photo comparison mode (side-by-side front, side, back).

Ad-free experience.

Priority support.

4. Monetization Model
One-time Lifetime Offer after onboarding (5-minute countdown) → unlocks premium forever.

If declined, premium is later available only as monthly/annual subscription.

5. Platform & Stack Recommendations
Platform: Mobile-first (iOS + Android via React Native/Expo or Flutter).

Backend: Firebase or Supabase (auth, cloud storage, database).

Local Storage: SQLite or AsyncStorage for offline-first experience.

Charts: Chart.js or Victory Native for sleek, interactive graphs.

6. Conceptual Data Model
User: ID, name, sex, age, height, unit preference, goals, subscription status.

Measurement: ID, userID, type, value, date.

Photo Entry: ID, userID, date, front_image, side_image, back_image.

Reminder: ID, userID, time, repeat pattern.

7. User Interface Principles
Light/Dark mode toggle.

Minimal, clean layouts with plenty of whitespace.

Futuristic aesthetic: crisp edges, subtle gradients, micro-animations.

Motivational cues: color-coded progress, visual goal indicators.

8. Security Considerations
Secure cloud storage for photos (private buckets).

HTTPS for all network requests.

Account deletion removes all user data from cloud.

9. Development Phases
Phase 1: Core tracking features (weight, measurements, onboarding, dashboard, basic graph, photo capture & view).
Phase 2: Premium features (unlimited measurements, reminders, photo compare, ad removal).
Phase 3: UI polish, animations, theme toggle, optimization.

10. Potential Challenges & Solutions
Image storage cost → Use compression and size limits.

User retention → Reminders, motivational graphs, and premium features.

Paywall conversion → Scarcity (timer) and emotional buy-in after onboarding.

11. Future Expansion
Social sharing of progress (opt-in).

Web dashboard for data viewing.

Apple Health / Google Fit integration.
